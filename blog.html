                        The main differences between map, filter, forEach, and find are: <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Map:</span>It transforms each element of an array by
                        applying a given function to it and returns a new array with the transformed values. The
                        resulting array will have the same length as the original <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Filter:</span> It creates a new array containing only
                        the elements from the original array that satisfy a specific condition defined by a given
                        function. The resulting array may have a different length than the original array. <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">ForEach:</span>It executes a provided function once
                        for each element in an array. However, it does not create a new array or return any values. Its
                        purpose is typically to perform some side effects or operations on each element of the array.
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Find:</span> It returns the first element in an array
                        that satisfies a specific condition defined by a given function. It stops searching the array as
                        soon as it finds an element that matches the condition and returns that element. If no element
                        matches the condition, it returns undefined..

                        storage section storage and cookies?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-500 text-2xl px-7 py-5"><span class="font-semibold text-pink-600">Ans:</span>
                        The differences between local storage section storage and cookies are given below:: <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Local Storage: </span>It is a web storage mechanism
                        that allows storing larger amounts of data (up to 5MB) locally on the user's browser. The data
                        stored in local storage remains persistent even after closing the browser or rebooting the
                        device, and it is accessible only to the same domain that created it. <br>

                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Session Storage: </span>Similar to local storage,
                        session storage is a web storage mechanism that allows storing data on the user's browser.
                        However, session storage is limited to the current session or tab, and the data is cleared when
                        the session or tab is closed. It is also accessible only to the same domain that created it.
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-semibold text-pink-500">Cookies: </span>
                        Cookies are small data stored on a browser, used for session info, tracking behavior, and
                        personalization. They can expire or be session-based, accessible by server and client, and work
                        across domains.
